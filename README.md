# GEOG5995_Final_Project
This research project embarks on an exploratory analysis of the intricate relationship between economic activity status and student migration patterns within England and Wales. Motivated by the growing significance of student mobility in contemporary urban and regional planning, the study aims to unravel the complex dynamics that underpin these migration flows. The focus is particularly placed on English Lower Tier Local Authorities (LTLAs) as the unit of analysis, offering a detailed and localized perspective on the phenomenon.

Utilizing boundary data from the UK Data Service, the project delves into an in-depth analysis of various economic indicators and their potential influence on the migration decisions of students. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that economic status within specific regions will significantly sways the migratory trends among the student population. The investigation employs a robust methodological framework, leveraging Python's data processing capabilities, coupled with geospatial analysis and advanced visualization techniques, to dissect and interpret the intricate patterns that emerge.
